    <p>This cheese omelette is great for breakfast.When cooking an omelette, it's important that you keep the temperature on the low side, as you don't want it to turn brown.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
